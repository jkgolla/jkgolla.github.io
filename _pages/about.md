I am a geoscientist with interests in fluid-rock/fluid-mineral interactions in the environment. My work typically combines a suite of physical and geochemical observations with process-based modeling approaches in application to subsurface elemental cycling (e.g., rock weathering, organo-mineral interactions, geothermal mineral alteration). 

He earned his PhD in Geology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
